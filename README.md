# Data-Mining
In the pandemic era, the use of social media and twitter has become increasingly widespread. This study was motivated primarily by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social sentiments, mainly by the tweets and comments of prominent people in society and their reaction to tweets.
My goal is to try to quantify and interpret early changes in Twitter activity, content, and sentiment about the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as to extract all the hidden information related to each tweet from a specific time period. After that, we must refine the tweets, which is a critical step, so this research paper is attempting to find the most appropriate method for extracting or refining tweets.
